## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt about how to set background image in css, how to position it and set the repeating nature of it.

```css
background: url(./images/pattern-background-desktop.svg);
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: top;
```

### Useful resources

- [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/csSref/pr_background-position.php) - This helped me to perfectly set background using css.
