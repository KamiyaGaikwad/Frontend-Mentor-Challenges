## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

I learnt how to adjust background perfectly on the element by using background size property.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
body {
  background:url(./assets/images/background-pattern-desktop.svg);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: 100%;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background-size.php) - This helped me implement background size property.
